    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream🧁</li>
            <li>milk🥛</li>
            <li>granulated sugar</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>vanilla bean, split and scraped</li>
            <li>5 large egg yolks🥚</li>
            <li>vanilla extract🌿</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Make the custard base. </b>In a saucepan, combine the cream, milk, half of the sugar, and salt. Add the vanilla bean pod and seeds. Heat over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li><b>Temper the egg yolks. </b>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks and remaining sugar until pale and fluffy. Slowly pour about half of the hot cream mixture into the egg yolks while whisking constantly. This warms the eggs and prevents them from scrambling.</li>
            <li><b>Thicken the custard. </b>Pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a spatula, until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Do not let it boil.</li>
            <li><b>Chill the base. </b>Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove the vanilla bean and any lumps. Stir in the vanilla extract. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, preferably overnight.</li>
            <li><b>Churn the ice cream. </b>Once the base is cold, pour it into your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li><b>Freeze to harden. </b>Transfer the churned ice cream to a freezer-safe container and freeze for several hours to harden completely.</li>
