    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    
        <ol>
            <li><b>Preheat and prep. </b>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li><b>Cream the butter and sugars. </b>In a large bowl, use a stand or hand mixer to beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is creamy and light in color.</li>
            <li><b>Mix in the wet ingredients. </b>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li><b>Combine the dry ingredients. </b>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li><b>Combine wet and dry mixtures. </b>Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter and sugar mixture, beating on low speed until just combined.</li>
            <li><b>Fold in the chocolate chips. </b>Add the chocolate chips and mix briefly until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
            <li><b>Scoop and bake. </b>Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough onto your prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie to allow for spreading.</li>
            <li><b>Bake the cookies. </b>Bake for 8–10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set. For extra chewy cookies, you can bake for slightly less time. For a crispier cookie, bake for slightly longer.</li>
            <li><b>Cool and enjoy. </b>Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely</li>
        </ol>
